## Running the tests

This project uses JUnit5 tests and they are configured to run automatically in the `test` life cycle of Maven. They can also be run with the command `mvn test`.
Along with the code unit test, the code coverage is also measured. The test and code coverage reports generate in the `site` life cycle of Maven, or when using the `mvn site` command.

### Break down into end to end tests
